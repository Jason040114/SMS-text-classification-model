# SMS-text-classification-model
This project is an SMS text classification model. This model can be used to classify the incoming SMS text as scam SMS or non-scam SMS.
## Operating environment
1. Python 3.7 or later<br>
2. PyTorch 1.9.0 or later<br>
3. Scikit-learn 0.24.2 or later<br>
4. NLTK 3.6.2 or later<br>
5. Pandas 1.3.0 or later<br>
## Run command
First, run main.py<br>
Then, code will be executed in sequence:
1. Rule-based scam SMS recognition model
2. Scams recognition model based on traditional machine learning
3. Scams recognition model based on Convolutional neural network (add PCA dimensionality reduction)
4. Scams recognition model based on convolutional neural network (without adding PCA dimension reduction)
CPU and memory consumption increase in turn
